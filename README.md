# eslint-config-ultra

This is a eslint plugin ([http://eslint.org](eslint)) with my personal coding style. It is based on [standard](http://standardjs.com/) with some extra rules.

Usage:

```
# installing eslint again here is required for a local install
npm i eslint eslint-config-ultra --save-dev
```

Then, add the following snippet to your .eslintrc.json (very similar to a js/yml config):

`"extends": "ultra"`

Yay!
